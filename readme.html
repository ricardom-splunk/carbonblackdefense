There are two different sets of credentials for this app - a SIEM key and an API key. The action <b>get notifications</b> uses the SIEM key. This means the <b>siem_connector_id</b> and the <b>siem_key</b> asset configuration parameters are required to run the <b>get notifications</b> action. All other actions require use the API key, meaning that the <b>api_connector_id</b> and <b>api_key</b> asset configuration parameters are required for those actions.

NOTE: Test connectivity will only check the API credentials, it will NOT check the SIEM credentials
