There are three different sets of credentials for this app - a SIEM key, a CUSTOM_API key, an ORG key key and an API key. The action <b>get notifications</b> uses the SIEM key. This means the <b>siem_connector_id</b> and the <b>siem_key</b> asset configuration parameters are required to run the <b>get notifications</b> action. Some Actions requires CUSTOM_API key along with ORG key and All other actions require use of the API key, meaning that the <b>api_connector_id</b> and <b>api_key</b> asset configuration parameters are required for those actions.
